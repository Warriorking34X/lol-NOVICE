        <h2>My Codeday Experience</h2>
          <p class="learning-journe">The event was an amazing journey into the world of technology. I came in excited but unsure of what to expect, and I walked away with so much more than I could have imagined.</p>
    <p>One of the most powerful things about Codeday was the deep learning environment it created. It wasn’t just about coding—it was about learning how to solve real-world problems creatively and effectively. The workshops, the collaborative atmosphere, and the passion of everyone involved made it an unforgettable experience.</p>
    <p>During the event, I discovered something unexpected: a passion for building websites and creating animations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. From the basics of structuring web pages to making those pages come to life with animations, it was an eye-opening experience. It showed me that programming can be a form of art, and that every small line of code can lead to something visually impactful.</p>
        <p>Scroll down to explore my journey during Codeday, including some of the things I learned, created, and a few memorable mishaps along the way.</p>
